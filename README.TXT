It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

Part 2:
2.  0
3. the machine always trusts that the user inserted the right ammount of money and has no way to check or recourse 
if they didn't
5. the price is different
6. public class LabClass {} public class Student {}
7. you can't switch the places. You get multiple errors stating that it is expecting different things in those places (ex: <Identifier> expected)
   I think these errors do clearly indicate that keywords are in the wrong order.
8. It seems to work fine without the public keyword. There's no errors and you can still create instances and call the methods. 
9. you can't leave out the class keyword
10. fields: price,total,balance
    constructor: TicketMachine()
    methods: getPrice(),getBalance(),insertMoney(),printTicket()
11. it matches the class name and sets the value of the fields
12. int,Student,Server
13. alive,tutor,game
14. Student,Server,Person,Game
15. it doesn't matter what order you declare the field variables in
